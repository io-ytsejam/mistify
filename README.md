# Mistify

Mistify is a Peer to Peer music on-demand service fully created using TypeScript (React + Deno). The purpose of this application is to create a music service where users (including artists) create an infrastructure for the whole service by sharing resources of their devices.

All music library is stored in user's devices and share between them directly. Mistify use an external server only in process of creating a p2p connection. In the future, it is possible to totally eliminate this dependency. Mistify can even prepare and convert music directly on a user's device!

UI was created with mobile devices in mind, but adding music to the service might work only in a desktop browser. Mistify should work on modern versions of Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers.
